### Summary

The Drink API project is a Django-based web application that provides a RESTful API for managing and retrieving information about drinks. The project includes a Drink model, a serializer for handling API data, URL routing for different views, and views that handle CRUD operations on drinks. The README.md file provides instructions on how to clone the project, set up the backend, and use Postman for API testing.
